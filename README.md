# KOMIHASH - Very Fast Hash Function (in C) #

## Introduction ##

The `komihash()` function available in the `komihash.h` file implements a very
fast 64-bit hash function, mainly designed for hash-table, hash-map, and
bloom-filter uses; produces identical hashes on both big- and little-endian
systems. Function's code is portable, scalar, zero-allocation, header-only
inlineable C (C++ compatible).

This function features both a high large-block hashing performance (26.5 GB/s
on Ryzen 3700X) and a high hashing throughput for small strings/messages
(about 9 cycles/hash for 0-15-byte strings). Performance on 32-bit systems
is, however, quite low. Also, large-block hashing performance on big-endian
systems may be 20% lower due to the need of byte-swapping (can be switched off
with a define).

Technically, `komihash` is close to the class of hash functions like `wyhash`
and `CircleHash`, which are, in turn, close to the `lehmer64` PRNG. However,
`komihash` is structurally different to them in that it accumulates the full
128-bit multiplication result, without "compression" into a single 64-bit
state variable. Thus `komihash` does not lose differentiation between
consecutive states while others may. Another important difference in
`komihash` is that it parses the input message without overlaps. While
overlaps allow a function to have fewer code branches, they are considered
"non-ideal", potentially causing collisions and seed value flaws. Beside that,
`komihash` features superior seed value handling and Perlin Noise hashing.

An aspect worth noting, important to some users, is that `komihash` at its
base uses a simple mathematical construct, and uses no author-intended nor
author-fabricated information. The base state of the function is equal to the
first mantissa bits of PI, and can be changed to any uniformly-random values.
This means that statistical properties (collision resistance) of `komihash`
are not based on manual fine-tuning, but are a product of the mathematical
construct.

Note that this function is not cryptographically-secure: in open systems, and
within any server-side internal structures, it should only be used with a
secret seed, to minimize the chance of a collision attack (hash flooding).
However, when the default seed is used (0), this further reduces function's
overhead by 1-2 cycles/hash (compiler-dependent).

This function passes all [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher) tests.
The performance (expressed in cycles/byte) of this hash function on various
platforms is best evaluated at the
[ECRYPT/eBASH project](https://bench.cr.yp.to/results-hash.html).

This function and its source code (which is
[ISO C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99)) were quality-tested on:
Clang, GCC, MSVC, Intel C++ compilers; x86, x86-64 (Intel, AMD), AArch64
(Apple Silicon) architectures; Windows 10, CentOS 8 Linux, macOS 13.3.

## Discrete-Incremental Hashing ##

A correct way to hash an array of independent values, and which does not
require pre-buffering, is to pass previous hash value as a seed value. This
method may be as fast or faster than pre-buffering, especially if lengths of
values in the array are not small. An additional 1-2 cycles/hash advantage is
obtained if fixed-size values are being hashed incrementally (due to
compiler's branching optimization). In most cases, incremental hashing of even
a few 2-8-byte values may be faster than using pre-buffering if the overall
input length is not known in advance.

```
	uint64_t HashVal = komihash( &val1, sizeof( val1 ), Seed );
	HashVal = komihash( &val2, sizeof( val2 ), HashVal );
	...
	HashVal = komihash( &valN, sizeof( valN ), HashVal );
```

Note that this approach is not the same as "streamed" hashing since this
approach implicitly encodes the length of each independent value. Such kind of
hashing can be beneficial when a database record is being hashed, when it is
necessary to separate fields by means of encoding their lengths.

Discrete-incremental hashing of nested structures requires a "hash value
stack" where the current hash value is pushed into it upon each nesting, the
nested level starts at hash value 0, and the resulting value is hashed with a
popped previous hash value upon exiting the nesting level.

## Streamed Hashing ##

The `komihash.h` file also features a fast continuously-streamed
implementation of the `komihash` hash function. Streamed hashing expects any
number of `update` calls inbetween the `init` and `final` calls:

```
	komihash_stream_t ctx;
	komihash_stream_init( &ctx, UseSeed );

	komihash_stream_update( &ctx, &val1, sizeof( val1 ));
	komihash_stream_update( &ctx, &val2, sizeof( val2 ));
	...
	komihash_stream_update( &ctx, &valN, sizeof( valN ));

	uint64_t Hash = komihash_stream_final( &ctx );
```

Since the `final` function is non-destructive to the context structure, the
function can be used to obtain intermediate "incremental" hashes of the data
stream being hashed, and the hashing can then be resumed.

The hash value produced via streamed hashing can be used in the
discrete-incremental hashing outlined above (e.g., for files and blobs).

You may also consider using [PRVHASH64S](https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash)
which provides 8.5 GB/s hashing throughput on Ryzen 3700X, and is able to
produce a hash value of any required bit-size.

to a competing processor architecture; also, ICC for Windows does not support
the `__builtin_expect` and `__builtin_prefetch` intrinsics)

Notes: `XXH3_64` is unseeded (seeded variant is 1 cycle/h higher). `bulk` is
256000 bytes: this means it is mainly a cache-bound performance, not
reflective of high-load situations. `GB/s` should not be misinterpreted as
`GiB/s`. `cycles/h` means `processor clock ticks per hash value`, including
overhead. Measurement error is approximately 3%.

This is the throughput comparison of hash functions on Ryzen 3700X. The used
measurement method actually measures hash function's "latencied throughput",
or sequential hashing, due to the use of the "volatile" variable specifiers
and result accumulation.

The following method was used to obtain the `cycles/h` values. Note that this
method measures a "raw" throughput, when processor's branch predictor tunes to
a specific message length and a specific memory address. Practical performance
depends on actual statistics of strings (messages) being hashed, including
memory access patterns. Note that particular hash functions may "over-favor"
specific message lengths. In this respect, `komihash` does not "favor" any
specific length, thus it may be more universal. Throughput aside, hashing
quality is also an important factor since it drives a hash-map's creation and
subsequent accesses. This, and many other synthetic hash function tests should
be taken with a grain of salt. Only an actual use-case can reveal which hash
function is preferrable.

```
	const uint64_t rc = 1ULL << 26;
	const int minl = 8; const int maxl = 28;
	volatile uint64_t msg[ 8 ] = { 0 };
	uint64_t v = 0;

	const TClock t1( CSystem :: getClock() );

	for( int k = minl; k <= maxl; k++ )
	{
		volatile size_t msgl = k;
		volatile uint64_t sd = k + 1;

		for( uint64_t i = 0; i < rc; i++ )
		{
			v ^= komihash( (uint8_t*) &msg, msgl, sd );
//			v ^= wyhash( (uint8_t*) &msg, msgl, sd, _wyp );
//			v ^= XXH3_64bits( (uint8_t*) &msg, msgl );
//			v ^= msg[ 0 ]; // Used to estimate the overhead.
			msg[ 0 ]++;
		}
	}

	printf( "%016llx\n", v );
	printf( "%.1f\n", CSystem :: getClockDiffSec( t1 ) * 4.2e9 /
		( rc * ( maxl - minl + 1 ))); // 4.5 on Xeon, 4.5 on i7700K, 3.5 on M1
```

## Discussion ##

You may wonder, why `komihash` does not include a quite common `^MsgLen` XOR
instruction at some place in the code? The main reason is that due to the way
`komihash` parses the input message such instruction is not necessary. Another
reason is that for a non-cryptographic hash function such instruction provides
no additional security: while it may seem like such instruction protects from
simple "state XORing" collision attacks, in practice it offers no protection,
if one considers how powerful [SAT solvers](https://github.com/pysathq/pysat)
are: in less than a second they can "forge" a preimage which produces a
required hash value. It is also important to note that in such "fast" hash
functions like `komihash` the input message has complete control over the
state variables and the result.

Is 128-bit version of this hash function planned? Most probably, no, it is
not. While such version may be reasonable for data structure compatibility
reasons, there is no much practical sense to use 128-bit hashes at a local
level: a reliable 64-bit hash allows one to have 2.1 billion diverse binary
objects (e.g. files in a file system, or entries in a hash-map) without
collisions, on average. On the other hand, on a worldwide scale, having
128-bit hashes is clearly not enough considering the number of existing
digital devices and the number of diverse binary objects (e.g. files, records
in databases) on each of them.

An opinion on the "bulk" performance of "fast" hash functions: in most
practical situations, when processor's total memory bandwidth is limited to
e.g. 41 GB/s, a "bulk" single-threaded hashing performance on the order of
30 GB/s is excessive considering memory bandwidth has to be spread over
multiple cores. So, practically, such "fast" hash function, working on a
high-load 8-core server, rarely receives more than 8 GB/s of bandwidth.
Another factor worth a mention is that a server rarely has more than 10 Gb/s
network connectivity, thus further reducing practical hashing performance of
incoming data. The same applies to disk system's throughput, if on-disk data
is not yet in memory.

## KOMIRAND ##

The `komirand()` function available in the `komihash.h` file implements a
simple, but reliable, self-starting, and fast (`0.62` cycles/byte) 64-bit
pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) with `2^64` period. It is based on the
same mathematical construct as the `komihash` hash function. `komirand`
passes `PractRand` tests.

## Other ##

This function is named the way it is named is to honor
the [Komi Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komi_Republic) (located in
Russia), native to the author.

## Test Vectors ##

Test vectors for the current version of `komihash`, string-hash pairs (note
that the parentheses are not included in the calculation). The `bulk` is a
buffer with increasing 8-bit values; `bulk` hashes are calculated from this
buffer using various lengths. See the `testvec.c` file for details.
